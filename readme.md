# WAF and cybsersec scripts
These are just some basic python scripts to get acquainted with the basics of firewalls and the simplest ways to prevent a DOS attack, while also practising how to write python code. These scripts are meant to be used only on Linux and they require root privileges for them to run. 

The DOS_blocker and the firewall use the scapy external library and should be installed with pip. These firewalls are not meant to be used on production, they are just for education purposes.
